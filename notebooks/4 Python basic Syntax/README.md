## About Assignments
Moving on you will notice most classes have an assignment. All assignment questions will be found at the bottom part of class notebooks(file ending in ipynb). Submissions will be made on a weekly basis on the same form. We expect 3 submissions per week. Please make time in your personal schedule to go over weekly content and do the assignments.
